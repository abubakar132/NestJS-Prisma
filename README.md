# REST API with NestJS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL

This repository demonstrates how to build a backend REST API for a blog application called "Median", using NestJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Swagger. The goal of this project is to create a scalable and maintainable API for a simple blog platform.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will learn how to:

1. **Set up a NestJS project** from scratch.
2. **Integrate Prisma** with NestJS to interact with a PostgreSQL database.
3. **Document the API** using Swagger for easy access and understanding of available endpoints.
4. Implement **CRUD operations** for the `Article` model, including the ability to handle relational data and authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS**: Backend framework to build the API
- **Prisma**: ORM for database interaction
- **PostgreSQL**: Database to store blog data
- **Swagger**: API documentation tool
- **TypeScript**: Language for building the application

## Features

- **CRUD Operations** for articles (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **API Documentation** generated automatically with Swagger.
- **PostgreSQL** database integration for storing article data.
- **Prisma ORM** for easy database management and interactions.
- Authentication and input validation will be handled in subsequent stages.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running locally:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables for PostgreSQL and Prisma.
4. Start the application: `npm run start`

## Next Steps

The project will continue to evolve with the following features:

- Input validation and transformation.
- Error handling.
- Managing relational data.
- User authentication.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical guide for building a backend API with NestJS and Prisma, with clear and easy-to-follow documentation to help you get started with the stack and create a robust, full-featured blog platform.
